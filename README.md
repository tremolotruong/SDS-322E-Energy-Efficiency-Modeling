The Project:

This project involves analyzing specific building attributes and how they affect the energy efficiency of the building itself. The analysis of the attributes would be done by utilizing a regression model and comparing the building attributes to the heating and cooling loads of the building itself.

Goals: 

Analyze the relationships between 8 building attributes and 2 responses, heating and cooling load.
Compare the 12 different building shapes with the relationships of building attributes, heating, and cooling. 
Hypothesize which building shapes are the most energy efficient in terms of both heating and cooling loads. 
Determine which building shape characteristic(s) is the most crucial to efficient heating and cooling loads.
Create visualizations to represent heating and cooling efficiencies across factors.

Information about data:

The dataset comprises 768 samples and provides data on all 8 specific attributes and the heating and cooling efficiencies. The dataset provided to us analyzes 8 specific attributes which are: relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area( glass), and glazing area distribution. These attributes are then compared to the energy efficiency response variables which are heating and cooling loads. Each sample is 1 of 12 different building shapes that were evaluated. All 8 building attribute variables are denoted as X1-X8 and the energy efficiency variables are denoted as Y1-Y2.

Variables:

X1 Relative Compactness
X2 Surface Area
X3 Wall Area
X4 Roof Area
X5 Overall Height
X6 Orientation
X7 Glazing Area
X8 Glazing Area Distribution
y1 Heating Load
y2 Cooling Load
